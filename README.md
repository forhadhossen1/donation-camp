# 3 Project features

## 1 . Filtering by Category:
Implementing a feature that allows users to filter donations by category. Users are able to select a category (eg, health, food, education) from the dropdown.


## 2 . Pagination:
If you have a large number of donations, you can donate in different places. Showing a limited number of donations per page and providing navigation options to move to next or previous pages.

## 3 . Donation Details Page:
Create a detail view for each donation item. When a user clicks on a donation, they'll see more information about it, including a description, price, and an option to make a donation if they're interested.
